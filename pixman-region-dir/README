PIXMAN-REGION
=============

This is a library for performing boolean (and other) operations on
regions (lists of rectangles) - intersection, union, etc.

It's based on pixman (which is itself based on the well-used X11
implementations of these routines), with most of the stuff stripped
out which isn't related to region operations.

The raw C pixman region interface is preserved intact, or you can
use the included - new shiny - C++ binding.

BUILDING
========

This is intended to be used as a static library or included wholesale
into your application.

* Add pixman-src/*.c to your build system.
* Add the project root to your include paths
* #include <pixman-region/pixman-region.h>
  if you want to raw pixman C interface; the pixman_region*
  functions should be usable, see private/pixman.h for description.
* #include <pixman-region/PixmanRegion.hpp> for the C++
  objectified region wrapper.  This may be cleaner for your
  purposes, but only offers a (useful) subset of the full
  pixman region interface.

There is not (yet) a stand-alone build process.

LICENSE
=======

MIT license, see COPYING

TODO
====

* C++ interface generally untested
* C++ interface could do more
* Build harness - CMake?
* Strip more unused pixman interface/implementation away
* Better unit test and/or examples (there is a weak assertion-
based test, cribbed from the pixman source, as
test/pixman-region-test.c)
